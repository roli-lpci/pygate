Deterministic quality gate CLI for Python projects with bounded auto-repair and structured escalation evidence.

**PyGate is not a lint aggregator.** It is an AI repair interface for Python CI — normalizing output from ruff, pyright, and pytest into a unified schema, running bounded deterministic repair loops, and producing agent-friendly briefs when human (or model) intervention is needed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: ruff, pyright, and pytest must be available in your environment
pip install pygate-ci

# Run quality gates on changed files
echo "src/app.py" > changed.txt
pygate run --mode canary --changed-files changed.txt

# Generate agent brief from failures
pygate summarize --input .pygate/failures.json

# Attempt bounded repair
pygate repair --input .pygate/failures.json --max-attempts 3
```

## What It Does

PyGate runs deterministic quality gates on your Python project and produces structured, machine-readable artifacts designed for both humans and AI agents.

### Gates

| Gate | Tool | Canary | Full |
|------|------|--------|------|
| **lint** | ruff | yes | yes |
| **typecheck** | pyright | yes | yes |
| **test** | pytest | configurable | yes |

### How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Changed Files] --> B[Run Gates]
    B --> C{Findings?}
    C -- No --> D[Pass ✓]
    C -- Yes --> E[Repair Loop]
    E --> F{Improved?}
    F -- Fixed --> D
    F -- No --> G[Escalate with Evidence]
```

1. You tell PyGate which files changed (from your CI diff, PR, etc.)
2. It runs lint, typecheck, and optionally tests
3. Findings are normalized into a unified schema with severity, rule codes, and evidence
4. The repair loop applies safe deterministic fixes (ruff --fix + format)
5. If it can't fix everything, it escalates with structured evidence explaining why

## Commands

```
pygate run --mode canary|full --changed-files <path>
pygate summarize --input .pygate/failures.json
pygate repair --input .pygate/failures.json [--max-attempts N]
```

**Exit codes:** `0` = pass, `1` = fail (`run`), `2` = escalated (`repair`)

> **Note:** The PyPI package is `pygate-ci` but the CLI command is `pygate`.

## Artifacts

All artifacts are written to `.pygate/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `failures.json` | Structured findings with severity, rule codes, and evidence |
| `run-metadata.json` | Gate execution traces (commands, stdout, stderr, durations) |
| `agent-brief.json` | Priority actions and retry policy for AI agents |
| `agent-brief.md` | Human-readable summary |
| `repair-report.json` | Repair attempt history (on success) |
| `escalation.json` | Escalation reason and evidence (on failure) |

JSON Schema files for all artifact types are available in [`schemas/`](schemas/) for downstream validation and code generation. See [`demo/artifacts/`](demo/artifacts/) for sample output.

## Repair Loop

The repair command runs a bounded deterministic repair loop:

1. **Backup** workspace
2. **Fix** via `ruff check --fix` + `ruff format` on scoped files
3. **Re-run** gates to measure improvement
4. **Decide**: pass (done), worsened (rollback), no improvement (escalate)

### Policy Defaults

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Max attempts | 3 |
| Max patch lines | 150 |
| No-improvement abort | 2 consecutive |
| Time cap | 20 minutes |

### Escalation Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `NO_IMPROVEMENT` | 2+ consecutive attempts with no finding reduction |
| `PATCH_BUDGET_EXCEEDED` | Edit exceeded line budget |
| `UNKNOWN_BLOCKER` | Max attempts exhausted |
| `UNRESOLVED_DETERMINISTIC_FAILURES` | Deterministic failures remain after repair |
| `ARCHITECTURAL_CHANGE_REQUIRED` | Structural issues beyond repair scope (reserved) |
| `FLAKY_EVALUATOR` | Gate produces inconsistent results (reserved) |
| `ENVIRONMENT_DRIFT` | Python version or dependency mismatch (reserved) |
| `TEST_FIXTURE_OR_EXTERNAL_DEP` | Tests depend on network, DB, or time (reserved) |

## Configuration

Configure via `pygate.toml` (standalone) or `[tool.pygate]` in `pyproject.toml`:

**pygate.toml:**
```toml
[policy]
max_attempts = 3
max_patch_lines = 150
abort_on_no_improvement = 2
time_cap_seconds = 1200

[commands]
lint = "ruff check --output-format json ."
typecheck = "pyright --outputjson ."
test = "pytest --json-report --json-report-file=.pygate/pytest-report.json -q"

[gates]
test_in_canary = false
```

**Or in pyproject.toml:**
```toml
[tool.pygate.policy]
max_attempts = 3

[tool.pygate.commands]
lint = "ruff check --output-format json ."

[tool.pygate.gates]
test_in_canary = false
```

## GitHub Action

PyGate ships with a composite GitHub Action for CI integration:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: roli-lpci/pygate/.github/actions/pygate@main
  with:
    mode: canary          # or "full"
    repair: "true"        # attempt auto-repair on failures
    max-attempts: 3
    python-version: "3.12"
```

The action detects changed files from the PR, runs gates, optionally repairs, and uploads `.pygate/` artifacts. The `post-comment` feature requires `pull-requests: write` permission in your workflow.

## Limitations

- **Deterministic repair only (v1)**: The repair loop uses `ruff --fix` and `ruff format`. It cannot fix type errors, failing tests, or issues requiring semantic understanding.
- **No incremental analysis**: All specified gates run on every invocation. There is no caching or incremental mode.
- **Tool availability**: PyGate requires ruff, pyright, and pytest to be installed in the target environment. It does not install them.
- **Single-repo scope**: Designed for single Python projects, not monorepos with multiple packages.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Model-assisted repair (LLM-powered fixes for type errors and test failures)
- [ ] Coverage gate (fail on coverage drops)
- [ ] Security gate (bandit / safety integration)
- [ ] Incremental mode (only re-run gates on changed files)
- [ ] PyPI trusted publishing via GitHub Actions
- [ ] Plugin system for custom gates
